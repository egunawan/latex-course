\begin{itemize}
\item You write your document in \texttt{plain text} with \cmd{commands} that
describe its structure and meaning.
\item The \texttt{latex} program processes your text and commands to produce a
beautifully formatted document.

\item Some commands also take \emph{optional arguments} in square brackets \keystrokebftt{[} \keystrokebftt{]}.

\section{(For students comfortable with \LaTeX) Drawings with \protect\tikzname}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{\insertsection}
\begin{itemize}
\item \tikzname{} is a package for drawing figures in \LaTeX.
\item It defines a powerful drawing language inside \LaTeX{}. Short programs can
draw surprisingly complicated things.
\begin{figure}
\href{http://www.texample.net/tikz/examples/rotated-triangle/}{%
  \includegraphics[width=0.35\textwidth]{rotated-triangle}}
\end{figure}
\item We'll start with simple things. To draw a line in \tikzname:
\vskip 1ex
\begin{exampletwouptiny}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw (0,0) -- (1,1); % a line
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{exampletwouptiny}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{\insertsection: Coordinates}
\begin{itemize}
\item The default coordinates are centimeters, with the usual sense: 
\begin{figure}
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.5]
\draw[help lines] (0,0) grid (3,3);
\node[below left] at (0,0) {$(0,0)$};
\node[below right] at (3,0) {$(3,0)$};
\node[above right] at (3,3) {$(3,3)$};
\node[above left] at (0,3) {$(0,3)$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{figure}
\item It helps to draw a grid when you are working with \tikzname:
\vskip 1ex
\begin{exampletwouptiny}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw[help lines] (0,0) grid (3,3);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{exampletwouptiny}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{\insertsection: Lines}
\begin{itemize}
\item Arrow heads and line styles are specified as options to the \cmdbs{draw} command.
\item End each draw command with a \keystrokebftt{;} semicolon.
\vskip 1ex
\begin{exampletwouptiny}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw[help lines] (0,0) grid (3,3);
\draw[->] (0,0) -- (1,1);
\draw[<->, thick] (2,1) -- (1,2);
\draw[<-, thick, dashed] (2,2)--(3,3);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{exampletwouptiny}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{\insertsection: Paths}
\begin{itemize}
\item You can specify multiple points to form a path.
\item Arrows will appear only at the ends of the path.
\vskip 1ex
\begin{exampletwouptiny}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw[help lines] (0,0) grid (3,3);
% axes:
\draw[<->, thick] (0,3)--(0,0)--(3,0);
% diamond:
\draw (1.5,0.5) -- (2.5,1.5) -- 
      (1.5,2.5) -- (0.5,1.5) --
      cycle; % close the path
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{exampletwouptiny}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{\insertsection: Colours}
\begin{itemize}
\item Colours are also specified as options to \cmdbs{draw}.
\vskip 1ex
\begin{exampletwouptiny}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw[help lines] (0,0) grid (3,3);
% axes
\draw[<->, thick, red]
  (0,3)--(0,0)--(3,0); 
% diamond
\draw[thick, blue, fill=yellow]
  (1.5,0.5) -- (2.5,1.5) -- 
  (1.5,2.5) -- (0.5,1.5) --
  cycle;
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{exampletwouptiny}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{\insertsection: Shapes}
\begin{itemize}
\item \tikzname{} has built-in commands for simple shapes.
\vskip 1ex
\begin{exampletwouptiny}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw[help lines] (0,0) grid (3,3);
\draw (1.5,2.0) circle (0.5);
\draw (0.5,0.5) rectangle (2.5,1.5);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{exampletwouptiny}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{\insertsection: Nodes \& Labels}
\begin{itemize}
\item Use nodes to place text (and math) in \tikzname{} drawings.
\item You can also use nodes as coordinates --- useful for diagrams.
\vskip 1ex
\begin{exampletwouptiny}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw[help lines] (0,0) grid (3,3);
\node (h) at (0,0) {H};
\node (x) at (1.5,1.5) {$\xi$};
\node (t) at (3,0) {T};
\draw[->] (x) -- (h);
\draw[->] (x) -- (t);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{exampletwouptiny}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{\insertsection: Functions}
\begin{itemize}
\item You can even plot some simple functions.
\vskip 1ex
\begin{exampletwouptiny}
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.5]
% y axis
\draw[<->, thick] (0,2) -- (0,-2);
% x axis
\draw[ ->, thick] (0,0) -- (7, 0); 
% curves
\draw[cyan,domain=0:2*pi]
  plot (\x, {sin(\x r)});
\draw[magenta,domain=0:2*pi]
  plot (\x, {cos(\x r)});
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{exampletwouptiny}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{\insertsection: Examples}
\begin{itemize}
\item Check out \fbox{\href{http://texample.net/tikz/}{\TeX{}ample.net}} for many \tikzname{} examples:
\end{itemize}
\begin{figure}

\section{Notes with \protect\bftt{todonotes}}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{\insertsection}
\begin{itemize}
\item The \cmdbs{todo} command from the \bftt{todonotes} package is great for
leaving notes to yourself and your collaborators.
\begin{exampletwouptiny}
\todo{add results}
\todo[color=blue!20]{fix method}
\end{exampletwouptiny}
\vskip 2ex
\item Pro Tip: define your own commands with \cmdbs{newcommand}
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\scriptsize,frame=single]{latex}
\newcommand{\alice}[1]{\todo[color=green!40]{#1}}
\newcommand{\bob}[1]{\todo[color=purple!40]{#1}}
\end{minted}
This can save a lot of typing:
\begin{exampletwouptiny}
\alice{add results}
\bob{fix method}
\end{exampletwouptiny}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{\insertsection}
\begin{columns}
  \begin{column}{0.4\textwidth}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Only inline notes are supported with beamer, but margin notes are
    supported for normal documents.
    \item There is also a handy \cmdbs{listoftodos} command.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{column}
  \begin{column}{0.6\textwidth}

\begin{itemize}
\item Now that you've seen how \LaTeX{} can replace Word and PowerPoint, what
about Excel?
\item Homework: try the \fbox{\href{http://www.ctan.org/pkg/spreadtab}{\bftt{spreadtab} package}}!
